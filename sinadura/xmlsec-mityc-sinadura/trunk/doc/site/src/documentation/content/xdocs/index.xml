	<p>
	  Version 1.4.1 of the Java library has been released. This is a bugfix 
	  release that contains a major bugfix to the canonicalization engine 
	  introduced in the 1.4 release. It is recommended that 1.4 users 
	  upgrade to the new version as signatures containing non ascii 
          characters created by this library are not according to the standard, 
	  and will be only validated by 1.4 library. 
        </p>

      <title>The Project</title>
      <p>
        The XML Security project is aimed at providing implementation of
        security standards for XML.  Currently the focus is on the W3C
        standards :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><jump href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">
            XML-Signature Syntax and Processing; and</jump>
        </li>
        <li><jump href="http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/">
            XML Encryption Syntax and Processing.</jump></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once these are implemented, 
        <jump href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XKMS">XML Key Management</jump>
          is likely to be the next focus for the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two libraries are currently available.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A Java library, which includes a mature Digital Signature 
          and Encryption implementation. It also includes the standard JSR
	  105 (Java XML Digital Signature) API. Applications can use the 
	  standard JSR 105 API or the Apache XML Security API to create
	  and validate XML Signatures.</li>
        <li>A C++ library is also now available.  Functionality is currently
		  more basic than that provided by the Java library.</li>
      </ol>
