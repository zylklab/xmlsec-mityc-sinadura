    <title>Installing the C++ Library</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <section> 
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <p>
		The library requires OpenSSL for cryptographic support.  Xalan-C
		is also required if XPath and/or XSLT transformations are required.
      </p>
	  <p>
		Version 1.4.0 of the library has been tested with version 2.8 
        of Xerces-C, and Version 0.9.7 (and above) of OpenSSL.
	  </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Getting the source</title>
      <p>
		You can download the sources via WWW in the distribution directory
		from one of the Apache  
		<jump href="site:about/download">
		  mirrors
		</jump>.
      </p>
      <p>
		This project's SVN repository can be checked out directly from
		https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xml/security/trunk/c
      </p>
      <p>
		A HTTP interface to browse the sources online is available via 
		<jump href="site:getting-involved/SVN">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xml/security/trunk/c/</jump>
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
	  <title>Building for UNIX</title>
	  <p>
		XML-Security-C is currently fully supported on Linux, FreeBSD and 
		Solaris.  It is partially supported (in cases where Xalan is not 
		required) on NetBSD and Cygwin.  It has been built and 
		tested using GNU gcc 3.x/4.x, Sun Workshop (Solaris), and GNU make.
	  </p>
	  <section>
		<title>Set up the Environment</title>
		<p>
		  The build process has been automated as much as possible to rely on
		  standard configure and make commands and not environment variables.
		</p>
		<p>
		  If configure cannot find anything for Xalan, it will assume that
		  you are not interested in XPath or XSLT support and will compile
		  XSEC without linking to Xalan.  Any attempt to use these features
		  will raise an exception in the library.
		</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
		<title>Configure</title>
		<p>
		  Now go to the root directory and run the command
		  <em>./configure</em>.  This will create the necessary makefiles
		  and header files necessary to build the package.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In addition to the standard options, <em>configure</em> can be 
		  passed a number of XSEC specific options :
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><em>--without-xalan</em> disable linkage to Xalan.</li>
          <li><em>--with-xerces=&lt;dir&gt;</em> define Xerces directory 
            rather than use XERCESCROOT</li>
          <li><em>--with-openssl=&lt;dir&gt;</em> define OpenSSL directory 
            rather than use OPENSSLROOT</li>
		  <li><em>--enable-debug</em> cause the library to be built with symbols</li>
		</ul>
		<note>
		  Using the <em>--without-xalan</em> option will automatically mean
		  that the library does not support XPath or XSLT transformations
		  (although envelope transforms will work as the library can now
		  perform these without going through an XPath transform).
		</note>
	  </section>
	  <section>
		<title>Compile</title>
		<p>
		  Assuming the output of the above command looks reasonable simply
		  type <em>make</em> (or <em>gmake</em> - you must use the GNU
		  make utility) in the base directory.  This
		  will make the shared library.  In addition,  <em>make tools</em>
		  will make the tools (or examples) in the src/tools directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		  The make process will create three directories in the distribution
		  directory:
		</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><em>include</em> - All public header files are copied here</li>
		  <li><em>bin</em> - Where the tools are placed once compiles </li>
		  <li><em>lib</em> - Where the shared library is place</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		  You may need to set up your <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment
		  variable to ensure ld.so will find the new shared libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Finally - you can use <em>make clean</em> and <em>make distclean</em>
		  to remove all binaries and libraries (former) and build scripts (latter)
		</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
		<title>Install</title>
		<p>
		  <em>make install</em> can be used to install the library and the
		  include files into the relevant directories (which can be set via
		  the <em>configure</em> script using the various <em>--prefix=</em>
		  options.
		</p>
	  </section>

	  <title>Building for Windows</title>
	  <p>
		XML-Security-C has been built and tested on Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0
		and 2005 compilers. The following subsections briefly describe how to 
		rebuild the library, tools and samples using the supplied workspaces.
		The specific information is for VC6, but the process for 2005 is similar.
	  </p>
	  <note>
		As of version 0.2, the library can be built without OpenSSL on a
		Windows platform.  (The WinCAPI provider will be used instead).
		See below for details on how to do this.  This is still experimental,
		but should work.
	  </note>
	  <section>
		<title>Setup Directories</title>
		<p>
		  The workspace and project files provided do not make any assumptions
		  about where Xerces, Xalan or OpenSSL might be on the system.  The
		  first step is therefore to configure VC directories under 
		  Tools->Options (Directories).
		</p>
		<p>
		  For the Include directories you will need something similar to my
		  setup below (replacing D:\PROG\CLIB\.. with the appropriate path
		  on your system).
		</p>
		<figure src="images/vc6a.gif" alt="Include Directories"/>
		<p>
		  Similarly the library directories will need to be added to.  Note
		  that in the example below, I use both Debug and Release libraries
		  for Xalan and Xerces.  As provided, the workspace projects link to
		  the debug libraries for XSEC Debug and Release for XSEC Release.
		</p>
		
		<figure src="images/vc6b.gif" alt="Link Directories"/>

	  </section>
	  <section>
		<title>Configure</title>
		<p>
		  If you are using Xalan and OpenSSL, no configuration is required when
		  building from the Visual C++ v6.0 workspace.
		</p>
		<p>
		  If you wish to disable OpenSSL, you should edit the file 
		  <em>.../src/framework/XSECW32Config.hpp</em> and comment out the 
		  line <code>#define HAVE_OPENSSL 1</code>.  This will effectively remove
		  support for OpenSSL from the library as it is being compiled.
		</p>
		<p>
		  You will also need to remove the library module <code>libeay32.lib</code>
		  from the link->General settings in each of the projects in the
		  XSEC workspace.
		</p>
		<p>
		  To enable support for the Windows Crypto API, edit the 
		  XSECW32Config.hpp file and uncomment the line 
		  <code>#define HAVE_WINCAPI 1</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		  To disable support for Xalan, a similar process is followed.  Edit
		  the XSECW32Config.hpp file, and <strong>uncomment</strong> the XSEC_NO_XALAN
		  line.  This will remove all support for Xalan from the various
		  source code files.
		</p>
		<p>
		  When compiling, using the "...No Xalan configurations for each
		  project.  These are the same as the normal debug or release builds,
		  but the Xalan library is not linked in.
		</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
		<title>Build Library and Tools</title>
		<p>
		  The main workspace (for VC 6.0) is found in :
		</p>
		<p><em>.../Projects/VC6.0/xsec/xsec.dsw</em></p>
		<p>
		  You can load this to build the tools or the library using the relevant
		  project.  (The library is xsec_lib.)  Project files for VC++ 7.0 and
          8.0 also exist in the appropriate Project directories.
		</p>
        <note>
          Note that as of version 1.3.1, Xerces 3.0 is supported.  However
          this uses an updated library file name, so this must be modified
          in <em>all</em> the projects in the workspace.  This can be set
          in the Linker option for all versions of Visual C++.
        </note>
		<p>
		  Samples can be built using the workspace found in :
		</p>
		<p><em>.../src/Projects/VC6.0/Samples/Samples.dsw</em></p>
		<p>All output will be sent to</p>
		<p><em>.../Build/Win32/VC6/Debug</em></p>
		<p>for the debug builds and Release for the release.</p>
