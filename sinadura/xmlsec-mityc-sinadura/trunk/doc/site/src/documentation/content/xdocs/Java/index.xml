      <title>Version 1.4.2 Released</title> 
      <p>
        Version 1.4.2 of the Java library has been released. This is mainly
        a bugfix release but also contains a few new enhancements including
        support for XML Canonicalization 1.1.
      </p>

    <section>
      <title>Version 1.4.1 Released</title> 
      <p>
	Version 1.4.1 of the Java library has been released. This is a bugfix 
	release that contains a major bugfix to the canonicalization engine 
	introduced in the 1.4 release. It is recommended that 1.4 users upgrade 
	to the new version as signatures containing non ascii characters created
	by this library are not according to the standard, and will be only 
	validated by 1.4 library. 
      </p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of the standard API JSR105</li>
        <li>Rewritten c14n that increases performance for signature 
        with node-set transformations.</li>
        <li>Memory footprint reduction and several bugfixes</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Overview of the Java Library</title>
      <p>
	The &packagenamelong; &packageversion; supports
	<jump href="ext:w3c/xmldsig_java_supported">&supp_java_dsig;
	</jump> and 
	<jump href="ext:w3c/xmlenc_java_supported">&supp_java_enc;
	</jump>
      </p>
      <p>
	As of version 1.4, the Java library supports the standard Java API
	<jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/105.jsp">
	  JSR-105: XML Digital Signature APIs
	</jump> for creating and validating XML Signatures. A standard Java
	API for XML Encryption 
	<jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/106.jsp">
	  JSR-106: XML Digital Encryption APIs
	</jump> is in progress and is not final, so this
	API is not yet supported. You can continue to use the existing
	non-standard APIs in the Java Library (there are no plans
	to discontinue or deprecate them), but you should consider moving
	to the standard APIs.

      <title>JDK 1.4 issues</title>
      <p>
	If you use JDK 1.4 and want to use this software, be sure that Xalan is
	properly installed. Check the <jump
	  href="site:java/installation">installation guide</jump>!!!
      </p>
      <p>
	I have so many complaints from people who argue that the software
	throws exceptions during running the examples or during unit
	testing. This package NEEDS a Xalan version after 2.2D13 (and SUN
	shipped his JDK 1.4.0 final with a Xalan beta!). I started integrating
	the installation guide into the exception messages cause it seems that
	people don't have a look at the installation guide.
